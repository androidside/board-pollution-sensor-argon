Notes call with Joe

Switch over to the c++ compiler

Compile all the c code with C++ compiler with g++

C is not a perfect subset of C++ so I will run into some issues

Always use a g++ compiler

Take the source code, I might need to wrap some things in the C code, if I call C code from CPP
IF DEF C++ is defined within 
Extern C, wrap the header file. 
Class Foo
methoid bar
symbol name
zcf7x

I need to call C++ from C++ !
Change my main.cpp bc I declare the .cpp object

Not compile C++ and C

Syntax between C and C++ 
Pass a function pointer has to be typecasted

Compiler
Platform you are going to be runniung on
What is the target architecture, which is noit windows is esp32

-----------
Steps:
Where the compiler is being called in the toolchain ( go through CMAKE files)
Replace the compiler definition (c=gcc) with g++

Replace main with main.cpp or anywhere where I call or instantiate a c++ file, needs to be .cpp

If the ESP idf library is only for C i might run into some small issues
